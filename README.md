# karaoke-api
node/express karaoke-based api mashup of spotify, genius, googlecloud's speech to text

# tasks left
1) Fix Node wrapped Spotify package:
	- Requesting necessary tokens does not work
	- Save a song's spotify_id to its matched song in our database
	- Save spotify's song track url to matched song
2) Write tests (and make them pass, obviously)
3) Fix GoogleCloud Speech to Text (Started with a GoogleCloud tutorial)
	- Implement browser mic access to stream live audio input
4) Lyrics marquee/highlighting logic and song streamage
5) Basic views (would probably implement w/ React/Redux since it is the freshest on my mind)
6) Refactor, refactor, refactor
7) Sing!
